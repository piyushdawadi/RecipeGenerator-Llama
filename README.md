# RecipeGenerator-Llama

This is a project created usin Meta's Llama where the user types the cuisine and the food they want the recipe for. The app then provides the user with the ingredients and cooking procedure for the food. The model used in this project is a part of Meta's Llama model, trained on 7 billion parameters. For the ease of visualization, the UI is created and hosted using streamlit. 
The link for the model is "https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML". 
You can download the model from the link and run the application in your local machine as well. Sonce this is a tuned down model, hosting even via the local machine does not require long time.
